1)With more hidden nodes, the modal has more capacity to learn complex decision boundaries. Accuracy improves at first

2)Small hidden layers underfit. Larger hidden layers fit better, but too many nodes can cause overfitting or unstable training. Accuracy improves up to a point, them may plateau or drop.
